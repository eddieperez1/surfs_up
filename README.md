# surfs_up

## Overview of Project
### Outline
The goal of this project is to investigate the weather data to open up a new surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. Using sqlite and flask, weather data was display on a local website. Information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop needs to analyzed. Specifically, the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu was investigated, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Requirements
The hawaii.sqlite is the database used in this project. The modules flask and sqlalchemy need to be installed to use the code in this project.

## Results
### Deliverable 1
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, a query will gather date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. This query will be imported into a DataFrame and the summary statistics will be generated.

### Deliverable 2
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, a query will gather date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. This query will be imported into a DataFrame and the summary statistics will be generated.

There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December

## Summary
### Outcomes
There is a high-level summary of the results. 

### Additional Insight
and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
